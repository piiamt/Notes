go to the file menu, and new.  Select "Java Class".

It will ask you for a name for the class.  Start this with a capitol letter, and no spaces you can use numbers.
	I would suggest using camel case:  ThisIsCamelCase

Note that the public class has the same name as the file.  This is a requirement in Java.
	
---------------

You will need a main function:
	public static void main(String[] args)
	
This is what will be called when you run your program.

To run your program, go to the run menu and select "run" or "debug".
